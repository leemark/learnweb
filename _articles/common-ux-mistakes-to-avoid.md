User experience can make or break your website. Even small UX mistakes can frustrate users, increase bounce rates, and hurt conversions. Here are 10 common UX mistakes and how to fix them.

## 1. Hidden or Unclear Navigation

**The Mistake:** Users can't find what they're looking for because navigation is hidden, vague, or overly creative.

**The Fix:**
- Use clear, descriptive labels (not "Solutions" when you mean "Products")
- Keep main navigation visible and consistent across pages
- Follow conventions—logo links to home, nav at top or side
- Include a search function for content-heavy sites

## 2. Auto-Playing Videos and Audio

**The Mistake:** Videos or music start playing automatically when users visit your page.

**The Fix:**
- Never auto-play audio (it's also an accessibility issue)
- If you must auto-play video, mute it by default
- Provide obvious controls to pause/stop
- Consider users' bandwidth and battery life

## 3. Tiny Click Targets on Mobile

**The Mistake:** Buttons and links are too small to tap comfortably on touchscreens.

**The Fix:**
- Make tap targets at least 44x44 pixels (iOS) or 48x48 pixels (Android)
- Add enough spacing between clickable elements
- Test on actual devices, not just browser resize
- Use the entire card/row as a clickable area when possible

## 4. Poor Form Design

**The Mistake:** Forms are confusing, ask for too much information, or provide unclear error messages.

**The Fix:**
- Only ask for essential information
- Use appropriate input types (email, tel, date pickers)
- Provide inline validation with helpful error messages
- Show password requirements upfront, not after failure
- Save progress for long forms
- Use autofill-friendly field names

## 5. Weak Visual Hierarchy

**The Mistake:** Everything looks equally important, so nothing stands out.

**The Fix:**
- Use size, color, and whitespace to establish importance
- Make primary actions prominent (larger, high-contrast buttons)
- Use headings to break up content logically
- Limit fonts to 2-3 typefaces maximum
- Use consistent spacing patterns

## 6. Ignoring Loading States

**The Mistake:** Users don't know if their action worked or if the page is frozen.

**The Fix:**
- Show loading spinners or progress indicators
- Provide feedback for every user action
- Use skeleton screens for content loading
- Set realistic expectations ("This may take 30-60 seconds")
- Allow users to cancel long operations

## 7. Unclear Calls-to-Action

**The Mistake:** Users don't know what to do next or buttons use vague language.

**The Fix:**
- Use action-oriented language ("Start Free Trial" not "Submit")
- Make CTAs stand out visually
- Limit to one primary CTA per screen when possible
- Place CTAs where users expect them
- Use contrasting colors for important actions

## 8. Non-Responsive or Broken Mobile Experience

**The Mistake:** Site doesn't work well on mobile devices, or mobile version lacks key features.

**The Fix:**
- Use responsive design, not separate mobile sites
- Test on multiple device sizes and browsers
- Ensure all functionality works on mobile
- Don't hide important content on mobile
- Consider thumb zones for navigation

## 9. Ignoring User Feedback

**The Mistake:** Success and error messages are missing, confusing, or appear in unexpected places.

**The Fix:**
- Confirm actions ("Your order was placed successfully")
- Explain errors clearly ("Password must include a number")
- Place messages near the relevant action
- Use appropriate colors (red for errors, green for success)
- Don't rely solely on color (use icons too)

## 10. Overwhelming Users with Choices

**The Mistake:** Too many options cause decision paralysis and abandonment.

**The Fix:**
- Limit choices when possible (Hick's Law)
- Use progressive disclosure—show details on demand
- Provide smart defaults and recommendations
- Group related options
- Consider multi-step flows instead of one giant form

## Quick UX Audit Checklist

Use this checklist to evaluate your site:

- [ ] Can users complete primary tasks in 3 clicks or fewer?
- [ ] Is navigation consistent across all pages?
- [ ] Are buttons and links easy to identify and click/tap?
- [ ] Do forms have clear labels and helpful error messages?
- [ ] Is there a clear visual hierarchy on each page?
- [ ] Do all user actions have feedback (loading, success, errors)?
- [ ] Are calls-to-action obvious and action-oriented?
- [ ] Does the site work well on mobile devices?
- [ ] Are success and error messages clear and helpful?
- [ ] Have you limited choices and avoided overwhelming users?

## The Bottom Line

Good UX is about removing friction and making things obvious. Users shouldn't have to think about how to use your interface—they should be able to accomplish their goals quickly and easily.

The best way to find UX issues? **Watch real users try to use your site.** Their confusion and frustration will highlight problems you'd never notice yourself.

Fix these common mistakes, and you'll see immediate improvements in user satisfaction and conversion rates.
