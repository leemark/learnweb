<h2>Sketching Before Building</h2>

<p>With a clear structure in mind from your information architecture work, it's time to start visualizing what your interface will actually look like. This is where <strong>wireframing</strong> and <strong>prototyping</strong> come in—techniques to visualize and test your designs before full development or final visuals.</p>

<p>Think of these as your design sandbox: you get to play with structure and interactions freely, fail fast, and refine the user experience on paper (or in a prototype) before anyone writes a single line of code.</p>

<h3>What are Wireframes?</h3>

<p>A wireframe is essentially a blueprint or schematic of a user interface. It's a simple, low-fidelity representation of layout and functionality, typically using boxes and placeholders instead of detailed graphics.</p>

<p>Wireframes outline where key elements will go on each page—headers, navigation menus, content sections, buttons—and how screens might flow or connect. Crucially, wireframes <strong>do not include</strong> final visual design details such as color, actual images, or polished typography. They focus on <em>structure and hierarchy</em> of content.</p>

<p>As the Interaction Design Foundation puts it: wireframes "serve as a blueprint that helps designers, developers, and stakeholders understand the placement of elements like headers, buttons, navigation, and content blocks" without distraction from visual styling.</p>

<h3>Why Wireframe?</h3>

<p>Wireframing is a powerful step because it allows the team to focus on <em>what</em> an interface does and <em>how it's organized</em>, rather than how it looks. Some benefits of wireframing include:</p>

<h4>Visualizing Ideas Early</h4>
<p>Taking abstract requirements or ideas and sketching them out makes them tangible. It's much easier to discuss and refine a concept when you have a visual reference, even a rough one, rather than only a written description or mental image.</p>

<h4>Spotting Usability Issues</h4>
<p>By laying out content and controls in a wireframe, designers can identify potential usability challenges (e.g., too many steps in a process, or important features being buried) before a lot of time is invested. Wireframes reveal constraints and opportunities—perhaps you realize a page is too cluttered, or that a certain flow is unintuitive, and you can adjust early on.</p>

<h4>Easy Iteration and Collaboration</h4>
<p>Wireframes are quick to create and modify, which encourages feedback and collaboration. Team members and stakeholders can review wireframes and give input ("move this section here," "add a forgot password link there") without the team feeling like anything is "set in stone."</p>

<p>Because wireframes are low-fidelity, people are less likely to get hung up on details ("This color is wrong") and more likely to focus on high-level issues ("I can't find where to login"). This makes them great for brainstorming and refining ideas collectively.</p>

<h4>Saving Time and Cost</h4>
<p>It's much cheaper and easier to revise a sketch or wireframe than to rewrite code or redesign a high-fidelity mockup. By resolving major layout and flow issues at the wireframing stage, you avoid expensive changes later in the development cycle. In other words, <strong>fail fast and cheap</strong> at the wireframe stage rather than after you've built the real product.</p>

<h3>Creating Wireframes</h3>

<p>You can start wireframing with nothing more than pencil and paper. In fact, many UX designers begin with hand-drawn sketches of the interface—this keeps the process extremely quick and flexible.</p>

<p>Sketch multiple ideas for a layout, explore different arrangements of elements, and don't worry about perfection. At this stage, quantity and variety of ideas matter more than polish. It's often useful to sketch a few alternatives for a screen to consider different approaches.</p>

<p>After sketching, designers typically move to digital wireframing tools for more precision and to create a sharable artifact. There are many tools (like Figma, Balsamiq, Adobe XD, etc.), but any tool that lets you draw boxes, shapes, and import placeholder text or images can work.</p>

<p><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Use greyscale tones or simple outlines; indicate images with a box with an X through it; use Lorem Ipsum or dummy text to represent copy. The goal is clarity—anyone viewing the wireframe should understand the layout and priority of elements without being distracted by color or visual flair.</p>

<h4>When Wireframing, Emphasize Content Hierarchy and Functionality:</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Mark what is the primary headline vs. secondary text (often by font size or position)</li>
    <li>Ensure the most important content or action is prominent (e.g., if it's a signup page, the signup form or CTA should be immediately visible)</li>
    <li>Check that navigation is present and clear (even if just a placeholder menu bar)</li>
    <li>Verify that interactive elements (buttons, links) are identifiable in the wireframe</li>
</ul>

<p>It's also good practice to wireframe not just individual pages, but consider the <strong>user flow</strong> between pages. This could mean creating a series of wireframes to illustrate a user task (for instance, wireframe the sequence of screens for "Password Reset" or "Checkout Process").</p>

<h4>Start Simple and Refine Gradually</h4>

<p>In the beginning, focus on core layout and functionality rather than visual polish—wireframing is about structure. Involving stakeholders early is helpful: share your sketches or wireframes with team members or clients to ensure everyone is aligned on the concept.</p>

<p>Be open to critique and <strong>embrace feedback</strong>—it's much better to pivot or adjust your design based on feedback at this stage than after development. Iteratively refine the wireframes, adding detail or making changes as the concept solidifies.</p>

<h3>From Wireframes to Prototypes</h3>

<p>While a wireframe is static, a <strong>prototype</strong> is an interactive simulation of the product. Prototyping usually comes after wireframing (often you create a prototype from your wireframes).</p>

<p>The fidelity of prototypes can range from simple clickable wireframes (low-fidelity prototype) to a close replica of the final UI with realistic responses (high-fidelity prototype).</p>

<h4>Why Prototype?</h4>

<p>Because it lets you and your users <em>experience</em> the design flow and catch issues that aren't obvious on a static page.</p>

<p>"Wireframes are static—to truly understand how your design performs, you'll need to create a prototype."</p>

<p>Prototypes model the interaction: clicking buttons, navigating between pages, opening menus, etc., so you can observe whether the sequence and behavior feel right. This is invaluable for usability testing. With a prototype, you can ask users to perform tasks and see if they succeed, long before any code is written.</p>

<h4>Creating Prototypes</h4>

<p>You don't need to prototype every last detail—focus on key interactions and user flows. For example, prototype a purchase flow or a sign-up flow. Modern design tools make it relatively easy to turn wireframes into clickable prototypes by linking screens and defining hotspots (clickable areas).</p>

<p>You might also simulate dynamic states (like a dropdown appearing, or a form error message) in a high-fidelity prototype.</p>

<h4>Best Practices for Prototyping:</h4>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Decide on the right fidelity:</strong> If you want quick feedback on layout and flow, a low-fidelity clickable wireframe prototype is fine. If you're testing more subtle interaction design or visual feedback, you may opt for higher fidelity. Don't waste time on high fidelity if it's not needed yet.</li>
    <li><strong>Plan the interactions you will simulate:</strong> Determine which buttons will be clickable and to which screen they lead, how navigation should work, etc. Start with the "happy path" (expected user path) and some alternate paths if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Use real or realistic content whenever possible:</strong> Replacing lorem ipsum with real labels or data in your prototype can reveal if layouts break or if text is too long for a button. It gives a more accurate sense of the final product.</li>
    <li><strong>Test and iterate on the prototype:</strong> Treat it as an experiment—when you conduct usability tests on it, note any confusion or errors users have, and adjust the design accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this stage, also remember accessibility and edge cases. For example, ensure your prototype accounts for longer page titles or error messages (does the layout still hold?). Think about how the design works for different screen sizes—it's wise to wireframe/prototype both desktop and mobile views for a responsive website.</p>

<h4>Document Your Design Decisions</h4>

<p>As you wireframe/prototype (or at least keep notes), document your design decisions. If you make certain assumptions ("We put the search bar at the top because users said they expect it there"), note that rationale. It will help when communicating with developers or justifying choices to stakeholders.</p>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Wireframes are low-fidelity blueprints that focus on structure and functionality, not visual design.</li>
    <li>Wireframing helps you visualize ideas early, spot usability issues, collaborate effectively, and save time/cost.</li>
    <li>Start with paper sketches, then move to digital tools as needed.</li>
    <li>Prototypes are interactive simulations that let you test user flows and interactions before development.</li>
    <li>Focus on key user flows and interactions in your prototypes—you don't need to prototype everything.</li>
    <li>Test your prototypes with users to validate your design decisions and identify issues early.</li>
    <li>Fail fast and cheap at the wireframe/prototype stage rather than after the product is built.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end of this stage, you should have a solid blueprint of how the website will be organized and behave. Now you're ready to make it look great and ensure it's polished for the user—that's where visual design principles come in.</p>
